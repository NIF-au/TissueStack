Network Server</h1>



<div><p>This activity demonstrates the ease with which a program that embeds <span>Derby</span> can be modified for a
 client/server implementation that uses the  <span>Derby</span> Network
Server. </p>

<div class="p">This activity assumes you have performed the preceding activities
and have a working directory called <samp class="codeph">DERBYTUTOR</samp>, and have
copies of the program files from the <samp class="codeph">$<span>DERBY_HOME</span>/demo/programs/workingwithderby/</samp> 
directory. A basic knowledge of the <samp class="codeph">WwdEmbedded.java</samp> program
and experience starting and connecting to the Network Server are helpful.
You will need to use a text editor to create the <samp class="codeph">WwdClient.java</samp> 
program.</div>

<div class="section"><div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>As a convenience, the <samp class="codeph">workingwithderby</samp>
    directory contains a program <samp class="codeph">WwdClientExample.java</samp>
    which has already been edited in the appropriate manner. You can use
    this program directly as it is, or you can compare the contents of this
    program to the <samp class="codeph">WwdClient.java</samp> program that you will
    construct in this activity, to see how the changes are made.</div>

You will create a <span>Derby</span> client
program,  <samp class="codeph">WwdClient.java</samp>, by changing a few lines of the  <samp class="codeph">WwdEmbedded.java</samp> program.
You can run the client program in multiple command shells, allowing simultaneous
update from two or more sources. <p>You use two command windows (Server-Shell
and Client-Shell) in this activity. You use the Server-Shell to start the <span>Derby</span> Network Server and  display
Network Server messages. You use the Client-Shell to edit, compile and run
the newly created <samp class="codeph">WwdClient.java</samp> program. You set the  <samp class="codeph">CLASSPATH</samp> environment
variable in the Client-Shell to support the client JDBC program.</p>

<div class="section"><strong>Activity notes</strong> <p>In a client/server environment, the client
program is often used from other computers on the network. Whenever a system
accepts connections from other computers, there is a chance of abuse. To maintain
security, the <span>Derby</span> Network
Server defaults to accepting connections only from clients running on the
local  machine (<samp class="codeph">localhost</samp>). Before this or any other  <span>Derby</span> client program can access
the Network Server from another machine, additional steps should be taken
to secure the Network Server environment. Once secured, the Network Server
can be safely configured to accept connections from other machines.  Refer
to the "Network Server security" and "Running the Network Server under the
security manager" sections of the  <cite><span><em>Java DB Server and Administration Guide</em></span></cite> for
important information on securing the Network Server and enabling network
connections.</p>
<p>With the Network Server started, you can run the client
program simultaneously in multiple windows. To demonstrate this, open two
command windows and perform the substeps of the "Run the client program" step
in  each window. Both clients will operate without a problem. In contrast,
it would  not be possible for a program that uses the embedded driver (for
example, <samp class="codeph">WwdEmbedded.java</samp>) to access the database until the
database or the Network Server is shut down.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that
the client program does not shut down the database. This is because the database
is a shared resource in a client/server environment and, in most cases, should
be shut down only when the Network Server is shut down. If multiple clients
are accessing the database and one client shuts down the database, the remaining
clients will encounter a failure the next time they attempt an SQL command.</p>
<p><span>Derby</span>'s two architectures have
caused confusion for some new  <span>Derby</span> users,
who mistakenly  think that embedded is a single-user configuration. This is
not true. The embedded driver supports multiple simultaneous connections,
performs locking, and provides performance, integrity, and recoverability.
Any application that uses the embedded driver can open multiple  <span>Derby</span> connections
and then provide a means for multiple users to interact with the database
on each connection. The <span>Derby</span> Network
Server is an example of such an application.</p>
