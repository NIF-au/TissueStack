<h1 class="topictitle1">XML data types and operators</h1>



<div><p><span>Derby</span> supports
the XML data type and a set of operators that work with the XML data type,
but does not provide JDBC support for the XML data type.
The XML data type and operators are based on a small subset of the SQL/XML
specification. </p>

<p>The XML data type and operators are defined only in the SQL layer.</p>

<div class="p">There is no JDBC-side support for XML data types. It is not possible to
bind directly into an XML value or to retrieve an XML value directly from
a result set.  Instead, you must bind and retrieve the XML data as Java strings
or character streams by explicitly specifying the appropriate XML operator
as part of the SQL statements:<ul>
<li>Use the XMLPARSE operator for binding data into XML values.</li>

<li>Use the XMLSERIALIZE operator to retrieve XML values from a result set.</li>

</ul>
 Additionally, there is no JDBC metadata support for the XML data type.</div>

<p>The XML data type is not allowed in any of the clauses or operations that
are described in the section on expressions on LONG data types in 
<a href="cdevstandards806118.html#cdevstandards806118">Derby and standards</a>.</p>

<p>For the XML operators to work properly, <span>Derby</span> requires
that a JAXP parser, such as Apache Xerces, and Apache Xalan are included in
the Java classpath. If either the parser or Xalan are missing from the classpath, <span>Derby</span> disallows any XML-related
operations.  </p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Classpath and version issues</h4>
<p>Most Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) that are version 1.4 or later have
a JAXP parser embedded in the JVM. If you are using one of these JVMs, you
may not need to add any classes to your classpath. Some exceptions exist:</p>

<ul>
<li>In most version 1.4.2 JVMs, the version of Xalan that comes with the JVM is 
not new enough, so you must override the version of Xalan in the JVM with a
newer version by using the Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism described at
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/standards/" target="_blank">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/standards/</a>. To
use this mechanism, download and install a binary distribution of Xalan from
Apache and set the system property <samp class="codeph">java.endorsed.dirs</samp> to point
to the Xalan installation directory.</li>

<li>After JVM version 1.4, Sun renamed the JAXP packages. 
<span>Derby</span> cannot find these
renamed packages. If you are using a Sun JVM later than version 1.4, download
and install a binary
distribution of Xalan from Apache and place the <samp class="codeph">xalan.jar</samp> file
in your classpath. The <samp class="codeph">xalan.jar</samp> file automatically puts into
the classpath the other required jars that are in the same directory.</li>

</ul>
