built-in authentication mechanism is suitable only for development and testing
purposes. It is strongly recommended that production systems rely on LDAP or a
user-defined class for authentication. It is also strongly recommended that
production systems protect network connections with SSL/TLS.</div>

<p>To use the built-in repository, set <em>derby.authentication.provider</em> to <em>BUILTIN</em>.
Using built-in users is an alternative to using an external directory service
such as LDAP.</p>

by specifying them with the <em>derby.user.UserName</em> property.</p>

are <em>SQL92Identifiers</em>. Delimited identifiers are allowed:   <pre>derby.user."FRed"=java</pre>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>For passwords, it is a good idea not to use words that would be easily
guessed, such as a login name or simple words or numbers. A password should
